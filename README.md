# Bookmarks App
## Fun Little Bookmarks App
User wanted to save bookmarks and be able to go back to them later, all while rating them to personal taste. User also wanted to be able to sort through them depending on mood. Some days are a one star day. Some are a five.

As a user:

I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:

title
url link
description
rating (1-5)
I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app

All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating
I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view

Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link
I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list

I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark

Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required)
I can select from a dropdown (a <select> element) a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection

(Extension feature - optional) I can edit the rating and description of a bookmark in my list
